        This website shows the sequences of assigments in order to learn XML and
        JSON formats and how we can use integrated them with HTML and CSS from
        two perspectives of coding: Back-End and Front-End.

            This assignment consisted of creating a website put away on Github
            Server to manage the ten homeworks corresponding to CNIT-131A class.
            The main section comprises a table where we can link ten tasks. Its
            display improved using CSS attributes for the most critical tags
            (h1, table,p, and anchor).

          <td>
            This assignment publishes an XML file; I could understand how we can
            make it and how it can be linked with a CSS file to see it on
            Browser. Also, we apply a series of attributes with CSS, mainly with
            Grid display because we have a matrix related to book information.

          <td>
            This assignment explains how we create a Template XSL file in order
            to link it and publish an XML file, which contains information about
            bank accounts. With this Template- XSL file, we could apply
            different options: using the XSL: selector lets us get specific data
            from XML, applying Xls: For-Each for each node of XML file and put
            it away on Element Table, and applying CSS attributes through the
            Xls:choose option.

          <td>
            This assignment shows different features of XPATH and how we can
            work with an XML file. The most important activities I completed
            were how we could add style to the template and apply comparison &
            position testings with the objective create a report that takes
            values from an XML file.

          <td>
            This homework worked with Document Type Declaration (DTD), a way to
            validate the structure of an XML document. Our XML submitted special
            rules required for this homework. First, I use an internal DTD in an
            XML file. After I applied some regulations to complete the
            assignment: Each child element had an ID, and they were unique; a
            column called Color was optional. There are nested elements, so we
            need to apply the correct sequences of elements. Finally, we
            validated with some tools on the web that we can check DTD syntaxis
            and if it worked successfully on the XML file.

          <td>
            This homework applied XML Schema (XSD), the most famous way to
            validate the structure of an XML. The features include: First,
            annotation, where I wrote four conditions: The Name has a limit of
            30 characters. Age equal or more than 21 years old and default 21.
            For the Date element, this format is YYYY-MM-DD, and the Phone
            element is 3digits-3digits-4digits. So, it was required to apply
            complex & simple types, and I used some restrictions. Finally, the
            XSD was submitted with an XSD validator and completed successfully.
